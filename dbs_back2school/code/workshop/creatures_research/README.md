# Creatures Research

Steve works at Google Moonshot on natural creatures. He is trying to develop a
system which can output a report on number of eyes and legs given a list of
creatures. He proposes to use GoogleImage to look up for the creature's photos
then run those results through deep-learning eyes and legs detectors. The board
of directors like his idea and gave him three instances of ImageSearch, and one
for each EyeDetector and LegDetector. Help Steve by completing `RunResearch`
inside template pkg.
